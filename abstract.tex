Humanoid robotics is a fast-developing field encompassing a wide range of engineering disciplines to solve the challenges of robotics interaction in an environment designed for humans. In order to encourage this development many competitions exist around very common but highly specific human tasks, all of which aim to extend the field of humanoid robotics and general intelligence. In order to walk, robots need some method of actuating joints in a controllable, fast and energy efficient way.\newline
This project is to design and construct a single leg based on a custom developed humanoid robotic platform, focusing on the knee and ankle joints specifically. A single degree of freedom test rig has been constructed to test the feasibility of both the pneumatic muscles and the control scheme.
A mathematical model for the actuator has been used to inform the control system structure and allow the estimation of the current system state. Pneumatic muscles are a highly nonlinear actuator, this means that standard linear controllers have limited success in controlling the actuator position. Control can be achieved with only a static force map leading to an accurate, high-performance control scheme, however, pneumatic muscles also have their own dynamics, like hysteresis, some thermodynamic effects. \newline
Therefore, a nonlinear MPC controller has been implemented and theoretically compared to two other controllers. \newline \newline TODO This probably needs more about muscle design

The project described in this thesis is based in the discipline of Electrical Engineering. The key contributions to this project are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Performed a literature review of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pneumatic Air Muscle design parameters and construction,
        \item Various non-linear control methods,
        \item Static and Dynamic system modelling,
    \end{itemize}
    \item Designed a adult sized pneumatic leg based on pneumatic muscles,
    \item Designed and constructed a single degree of freedom pneumatic muscle test rig,
    \item Researched and constructed various pneumatic muscles to determine material compatibility,
    \item Designed a modular software framework that allows the use of varying controllers and system arrangements,
    \item Implemented a SMC controller,
    \item Designed and and implemented a MPC based controller and optimiser. 
    \item Implemeted a simulated pneumatic muscle plant.
\end{itemize}
